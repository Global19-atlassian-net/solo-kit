      Currently solo-kit event loops have the limitation where they need to watch the same namespaces for all resources
      in the event loop. However, for resources with more jitter, the ability to specify namespaces for each resources
      can reduce greatly the input jitter in the system. This PR adds an object to the EventLoop Run function which takes
      a map of resource watchers to namespaces.
