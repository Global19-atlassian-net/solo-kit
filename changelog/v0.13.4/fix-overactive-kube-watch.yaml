  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Fix memory leak in active (event-heavy) kubernetes environments which could lead to memory usage growing
      without bounds by ignoring update events where the new/old resource is unchanged, which significantly helps
      `KubeCoreCache` users keep pace with the pace of incoming events at steady-state.
