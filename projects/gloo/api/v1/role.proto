 * A Role is a container for a set of Virtual Services that will be used to generate a single proxy config
 * to be applied to one or more Envoy nodes. The Role is best understood as an in-mesh application's localized view
 * of the rest of the mesh.
 * Each domain for each Virtual Service contained in a Role cannot appear more than once, or the Role
 * will be invalid.
 * Roles contain a config field which can be written to for the purpose of applying configuration and policy
 * to groupings of Virtual Services.

The name of the role is matched to Envoy instances. Envoy instances will be assigned a config matching the role they report to Gloo when registering
Envoy instances must specify their role in the prefix for their Node ID when they register to Gloo.

Currently this is done in the format <Role>~<this portion is ignored>
which can be specified with the `--service-node` flag, or in the Envoy instance's bootstrap config.
