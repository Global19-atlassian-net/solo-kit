A Proxy is a container for the entire set of configuration that will to be applied to one or more Proxy instances.
Proxies can be understood as a set of listeners, represents a different bind address/port where the proxy will listen
for connections. Each listener has its own set of configuration.

If any of the subresources within a listener is declared invalid (e.g. due to invalid user configuration), the
proxy will be marked invalid by Gloo.

Proxy instances that register with Gloo are assigned the proxy configuration corresponding with
a proxy-specific identifier.
* In the case of Envoy, proxy instances are identified by matching the following string pattern `PROXY_ID~IGNORED`
 in the instance's [Node Id](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli). where
PROXY_ID is the name of the role the Gloo operator wishes to assign.
* Node ID can be specified in Envoy with the `--service-node` flag, or in the Envoy instance's bootstrap config.
